                                Boeing Commercial Airplanes from 1958 to 1979. Versions of the aircraft have a capacity of
                                from 140 to 219 passengers and a range of 2,500 to 5,750 nautical miles (4,630 to 10,650 km)

                            The Boeing C-135 Stratolifter is a transport aircraft derived from the prototype Boeing 367-80 jet
                            airliner (also basis for the 707) in the early 1950's. It has a narrower fuselage and is shorter than 707.
                            Boeing gave the aircraft the internal designation of Model 717. Since the first one was built in August
                            1956, the C-135 and it's variants have been a fixture of the United States Air Force.
